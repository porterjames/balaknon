a site for sharing poems in many languages. WIP (work in progress)

the idea for this site came from working with the Cebu Stray Poets Collective. we used to share a lot of poems on our Facebook group, but after a couple people decided to cut down their social media usage the group page became kind of dead. so, i began imagining a nicer site for sharing poems.

i'd like the final version to be
-- a distraction-free reading experience (i.e., one poem at a time, no scrolling feed, generous font size)
-- elegantly multilingual (i.e., should have nice support for bilingual reading/translations)
-- centered on marginal poetries (i.e., it should be easy to search for & find poems from colonized countries, professional & non-professional poets,  poems not in english, etc)
-- pretty! & easy to use
